        <h3>What's this all about?</h3>
        <p>
            Water quality isn't something we tend to think about, except when
            furiously de-scaling the kettle or dishwasher, but it's <strong>
            really quite important</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those of us on mains water, we just assume that water companies
            are adhering to regulations, and everything is fine. However, those
            using bore-holes and wells are always subject to ground water
            changes. Even when on mains water, there can be contamination, and
            this data isn't particularly visible, or updateable by the public.
        </p>
        <h3>What do you mean "Quality"?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>H<sub>2</sub>O Really?</strong> is here to provide an open
            data service through which water quality can be recorded,
            monitored, and reported on by anyone, with any available
            technology. We want all types of water quality indicators to be
            recorded, but even if you can only test the pH or make a casual
            observation about the water quality around you, we want to know
            about it!
        </p>
        <h3>Quality of what?</h3>
        <p>
            Obviously we all care about the quality of the water coming out of
            our taps, but this site is not just for drinking water. We want to
            know about the water in the pond at the end of your garden, the
            water in the stream that flows through the park, the wood,
            wherever!
        </p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            "Knowledge is power", so they say. Well, data is knowledge, of a
            sort. So the more data everyone has about the water around them,
            the more 'power' one has to act on issues that may arise. Not to
            mention, <strong>science is fun</strong>!
